# tumor microenvironments (TMEs) consist of several distinct major lineages
# including mast cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), conventional
# dendritic cells (cDCs), monocytes, and macrophages.

# Monocytes are usually classified based on the expression of surface markers
# CD14 and CD16

# Macrophages are critical mediators in TME and participate in multiple aspects
# of tumor immunity (DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019). The "classically activated" M1
# and "alternatively activated" M2 macrophage polarization system has been used
# to describe the in vitro activation state of macrophages (Vogel et al., 2014).
# However, macrophages in vivo exhibit more complex phenotypes, which argue
# against such a simple categorization in vitro.

# Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in antigen-specific immune responses
# (Mellman, 2013).  Two distinct cDC subsets, XCR1+CADM1+ cDC1s and CD1A+
# CD172A+ cDC2s, have been identified and shown to interact with CD8+ and CD4+ T
# cells, respectively (Binnewies et al., 2019; Salmon et al., 2016).

# Furthermore, the heterogeneity of cDC2s only starts to be revealed recently,
# as distinct cDC2 subsets in human blood and spleen have been identified (Brown
# et al., 2019; Dutertre et al., 2019; Villani et al., 2017). However, the
# complexity of cDC2s across tumors is still not fully characterized.



# Three DC subsets (hM02-hM04), plasmacytoid DC (pDC), cDC2, and cDC1 cells,
# characterized by high expression of HLA-DRs and low expression of CD14
# (Figures S4B and S4C), were also identified and were further distinguished by
# specific expression of LILRA4/LILRB4, CD1C/FCER1A, and XCR1/BATF3,
# respectively (Figure 2B).
# The remaining clusters were identified as macrophages based on their high
# expression of CD68, CD163, and MRC1 (encoding CD206).
